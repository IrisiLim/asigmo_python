10199,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,with Miriam Makeba’s Africa,Africa
10201,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,I’d noticed that my inner life,life

10204,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,thinking through it. The doctor said that Geodon,Geodon
10205,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,would loosen my thinking—I noticed,noticed
10207,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,that I’d been moving through life for 10 years,years
10208,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"in a Zyprexa mold. thought control, at its best,",best
10210,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,like a sonnet. I do not feel invaded,invaded
10211,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,by the television that I never see. Brenda made me,me
10213,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"feel more loved than ever this morning, as my thoughts",thoughts
10214,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"expanded. Last night, in the slow cooker, I made",made
10216,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,Lamb and Goat curry—amazingly good. I’d thought,thought
10217,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"to send Joel, and Peter, and Michael an email",email
10219,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"letting them know of my transition, but did not. The consequences",consequences
10220,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,of this transition could be catastrophic. I feel more loving toward Brenda,Brenda
10222,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"than ever. I could die, or worse. As I meditated today",today
10223,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,my books to the left of me seemed packed and dense,dense
10225,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"against the wall. Soon, Chuck will be here",here
10226,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,to play chess upstairs. I told the doctor this morning,morning
10228,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,that the philosophy and religion of the cyborg,cyborg
10229,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,have not yet been written. My,My
10231,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,poetry,poetry
10232,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,has just begun. I am,am
10234,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"a Fourth Form,",Form
10235,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"though not as Dodie saw it. Together,",Together
10237,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,we can belong in this world. Artaud,Artaud
10238,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,arrived at the double,double
10240,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,as I have. We share more in common,common
10241,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,than I’d known before last night. I need less sleep,sleep
10243,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"than before, and I sleep better",better
10244,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,and am more rested. I feel sad and cheated,cheated
10246,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,that I need to rely on drugs,drugs
10247,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,so completely. I wonder about Paul Bowles’ stories.,stories
10249,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,I need to reach out,out
10250,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,to others,others
10252,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"through this. The doctor, this morning, said",said
10253,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"that I was enlightened, but not",not
10255,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,quite there—somehow—I can’t remember,remember
10256,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,how. I doubt he knows,knows
10258,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,what he means by “enlightenment.” I felt far away,away
10259,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"from my sister yesterday, when she called. Michael",Michael
10261,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,talked to me of Christ’s,s
10262,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,tenderness. I feel tender in this moment. Over,Over
10264,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,and over I feel that words,words
10265,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,do not represent me. I am not,not
10267,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,sure what that implies of my intentions,intentions
10268,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"in using them. Yesterday, Brenda and I saw",saw
10270,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,the Warhol show of the last ten years,years
10271,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,of his life. There seemed to have been hope,hope
10273,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,to live meaningfully in capitalism then. ~~~~~~~ The waves,waves
10274,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"of this beginning, the new life of my mind",mind
10276,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,is settling. It’s been a while since I’ve written. I’ve decided,decided
10277,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,to mark my continuing with the seven tildes above. And I added,added
10279,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"a title tonight, Muerto Vecino, after Zizek’s dubious interpretation",interpretation
10280,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"of Kierkegaard’s neighbor, and because of the funeral home",home
10282,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"across the street. My thinking has changed, my being has changed,",changed
10283,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,I am more alert and more engaged in thinking through the world.,world
10285,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,And I am able to speak better. I don’t know what this means,means
10286,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,about who I am. I try not to feel let down that for so much of my life,life
10288,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,I’ve been restrained by psychotropic drugs. Before Zyprexa it was even,even
10289,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"worse, with up to 6 meds, as I’ve said over and over to friends. I feel",feel
10291,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"the need to make clear what my obstacles have been. Not for pity,",pity
10292,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"a little for pride, but also for hope. If I can do that, then maybe I can help",help
10294,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"someone not suffer so much, like Brenda. I replaced the kitchen faucet",faucet
10295,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,this past weekend. It makes me very happy that I was able to do it,it
10297,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"successfully, without ever having been handy before in my life, and after",after
10298,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,spending most of my life disdainful of being practical in that way. What a joy,joy
10300,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"to make Brenda so happy. I don’t know how much longer I will live,",live
10301,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"and have often thought, recently, that it would be tragic if I died anytime",anytime
10303,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"soon, but that it’s imperative that I accept death when it arrives, after",after
10304,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"affirming life as fully as I can. It’s too easy, and stupid, to be simplistically",simplistically
10306,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"oppositional. And to not know that people can ruin anything, but",but
10307,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"that the substantial things have value of themselves, is foolish. I don’t want to stop",stop
10309,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,at my own ignorance and lack of forbearance. I don’t believe in the West,West
10310,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"on its own. As Michael says, the only thing that makes sense here",here
10312,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,is love. I have everything I could possibly ever want or need for now. More books,books
10313,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"will come, more music too. And love is immeasurable",immeasurable
10315,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,when it’s real. I am so grateful to have more waking time,time
10316,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,on the weekends. I plan on making breakfast for Brenda,Brenda
10318,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,every Saturday and Sunday that I can,can
10319,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,from now on. Early. I see gardens in the future of our household.,household
10321,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,And I wonder about a Great Spirit. What does the name matter? I see the stones that live,live
10322,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"without water. I see the smoke that cleanses my vision, and a network of consciousness,",consciousness
10324,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"with each node another, on and on that way to the depths. My thinking will never",never
10325,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,grasp it all,all
10327,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,because of that recursively created network of interior life. My thinking stops,stops
10328,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"then, barely able to contain the spherical and vast darkness",darkness
10330,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,from which all light arises. That’s why what I see is dark. It is brilliant,brilliant
10331,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,in its darkness. Like onyx and flint. I can only talk around what I’ve seen,seen
10333,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"the past couple of weeks. It reframes, completely, the rest of my creative",creative
10334,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"life and the rest of my days. All I aim to do now is to focus my attention,",attention
10336,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,so that I can see it all again in retrospect. So that I can read,read
10337,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"and gather more tools for understanding it. So that I understand myself,",myself
10339,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"and something of the world, and love, and so that I help others. Geodon",Geodon
10340,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"will not erase it. I’ve seen it already, many times. It is my natural state.",state
10342,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,I no longer see it as only hallucination. It is a way of being. A way that I can flesh,flesh
10343,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"out, here. Slowly. Carefully. And as I do, its destructive powers,",powers
10345,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"which are massive and righteous, will subside. As it will know that it is being",being
10346,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,given to the world. Because it belongs to all. And all will be there soon.,soon
10348,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"There are signs already. Because to see it is to break, unless one knows something",something
10349,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,of love. It makes LSD,LSD
10351,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,small. It is God and the Universe as One.,One
10352,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,I am not the first to see it. But I am a person,person
10354,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,given a chance,chance
10355,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"to write it, letter by letter, slowly, in terms of the light of my ignorance",ignorance
10357,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,to see more fully,fully
10358,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,what I do not know. I do not offer anything,anything
10360,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,but poems. But it breaks through,through
10361,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"my mouth to arrive at the hearts of the world, at the hearts of the horses",horses
10363,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"of the world, to allow us all to speak in silence. It is not God or the Universe.",Universe
10364,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,It is One as All in you. Because I cannot see through myself,myself
10366,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,without it. I see clearly,clearly
10367,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,that the sun will not arrive,arrive
10369,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,in this new weather. But that the moon,moon
10370,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,will take its place. I see clearly that the sun is there,there
10372,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"to bring meaning to the sky, and that the earth is more full",full
10373,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,with the light of the world,world
10375,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,extinguished for a brilliant view of wilderness. This is a view,view
10376,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,that extends through opposites,opposites
10378,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,and arrives at a single body,body
10379,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,to witness this song. And this song is not the answer,answer
10381,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"that you believe in, because one day",day
10382,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,I will speak to you again,again
10384,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,in the rain,rain
10385,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,and show you,you
10387,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,that I do not know. Because knowledge,knowledge
10388,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,belongs to the earth. And the earth makes everything,everything
10390,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,I know. And now that there is less and less freedom,freedom
10391,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"from coercion in a moneyed world, and now that Claire,",Claire
10393,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"a friend, is moving on to be Christ in her own way, now",now
10394,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,that Guénon continues to call me to understand,understand
10396,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"my ignorance, to depart again",again
10397,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"from the friends at Kuna Yala, where I helped with the water,",water
10399,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,with Brenda watching over me,me
10400,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"from a hammock between palms, now that Panamá",Panamá
10402,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,calls again to give me a union,union
10403,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"of the world, in more than two ways,",ways
10405,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"and to distinguish from the surface of these times, I",I
10406,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,receive,receive
10408,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,a call to awaken in the snow. I receive a call to acknowledge,acknowledge
10409,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,that Geodon has planted itself,itself
10411,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,with capital,capital
10412,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"in my consciousness, but that the world",world
10414,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,is stronger than to balance itself,itself
10415,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"from the ozone and people alone. We are not erased, and we",we
10417,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,do not control the earth. Geodon,Geodon
10418,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"is an act of kindness, an agreement",agreement
10420,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,to live this life,life
10421,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,in a way that arrives,arrives
10423,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,with the weather. It may continue,continue
10424,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"for the rest of my life, or it may not. I will not be afraid again",again
10426,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"to see things as I do, and I will not",not
10427,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"seek out the truth, intentionally, without some kind of agreement",agreement
10429,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"with this custom. Because that is a way, for now,",now
10430,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"that I speak. And it is useful, though better left",left
10432,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"invisible. And the name, Geodon, brings trouble, I can see",see
10433,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"through it enough, with enough love in my life, to believe",believe
10435,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,in the end of the reign of the Anti-Christ (not Obama). I need to learn again,again
10436,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,to be and to write. But to deliver,deliver
10438,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,what I saw,saw
10439,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,I must return,return
10441,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"to the explosion of my inner life. To start with, otherwise and generally, I see",see
10442,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,only outlines. Creation manifests,manifests
10444,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"from every direction, in an infinity",infinity
10445,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,of dimensions. Most of us,us
10447,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,spend most of our energy,energy
10448,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,conscious of a very few of these dimensions. Imagine,Imagine
10450,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,more than the greatest works of art,art
10451,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,manifesting endlessly,endlessly
10453,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,from more directions than one can possibly count,count
10454,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"every micro second, timelessly. It’s glorious.",glorious
10456,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,And the only way to see it with any balance,balance
10457,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"is impeccably, ethically, compassionately, and with at least an aim",aim
10459,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,toward the Divine. It IS the Divine. God and the Universe,Universe
10460,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"spoke to me. It is all, always, speaking to us. And what it says",says
10462,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,is endless,endless
10463,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,it brings wholeness,wholeness
10465,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,to the precious moment. It goes away,away
10466,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"when one tries to pin it down, as I do. I say less and less",less
10468,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,as I try to describe it. It is endlessly,endlessly
10469,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,generative. It is good,good
10471,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,but pitiless and merciful. It demands of us,us
10472,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,that we arrive. And now that the thinking manifests,manifests
10474,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,in a way that allows,allows
10475,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,"for union and a bridge, in a way that avoids",avoids

10585,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,I feel less. My voice can be loud,loud

10588,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,cannot be yoked,yoked
10589,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,in outlines. There is nothing I can do.,do
10591,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,There is nothing to expect. I can only,only

10603,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,I am a little less confused,confused

10609,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,at my experience. I am ignorant,ignorant

10624,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,is not limited by concept. And concept,concept

10673,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,to move it,it
10675,Bridge of the World,Roberto Harrison,but I saw this. Long ago. Briefly. I was offered,offered

But there were some conditions of it which I knew better than they could: namely, first, the precise and sharp distinction between the state of morbid inflammation of brain which gave rise to false visions (whether in sleep, or trance, or waking, in broad daylight, with perfect knowledge of the real things in the room, while yet I saw others that were not there), and the not morbid, however dangerous, states of more or less excited temper, and too much quickened thought, which gradually led up to the illness, accelerating in action during the eight or ten days preceding the actual giving way of the brain.",brain
